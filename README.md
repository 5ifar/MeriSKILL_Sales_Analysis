This repository serves as my documentation for the MeriSKILL Sales Analysis - Power BI Project.

It was created as a learning project as part of my Internship assignment at: [MeriSKILL](https://sites.google.com/view/meriskill/home) during May - June 2024.

It showcases my competancy to work with Microsoft Power BI and demonstrates my proficiency in essential Power BI concepts like Data Profiling, ETL with Power Query, Semantic Data Modelling, DAX Measures & DAX Calculated Columns, Dashboard Designing, Visualization, Conditional Formating, Filters, Bookmarks, Page Navigation, Publishing and Report Optimization etc.

The entire project has been implemented using Microsoft Power BI Desktop 2.128.751.0 and published on Microsoft Power BI Service.

### Purpose:
This report delves into a comprehensive analysis of the sales dataset provided by MeriSkill. The dataset spans from 1 January 2019 to 1 January 2020 and includes information about product sales, quantities, revenue and geographic data.

I analyzed sales data to identify trends, top-selling products and revenue metrics aimed at extracting valuable insights to facilitate strategic data-driven business decision-making and create visualizations to present my findings effectively.

### Sales Data Columns:
ORDER ID, PRODUCT, QUANTITY ORDERED, PRICE EACH, ORDER DATE, PURCHASE ADDRESS, MONTH, SALES, CITY, HOUR
